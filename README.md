# mini.css Flavors

[Mini.css](https://github.com/Chalarangelo/mini.css) flavors for the 'La boîte à bouillons' web sites.

Forked from the [Angelos Chalaris](https://github.com/Chalarangelo) [mini.css](https://github.com/Chalarangelo/mini.css) project (version 2.3.7 aka fermion.v2) to which we have refactored the flavor structure into several modules.

## Documentation

For instructions on how to use, best practices, templates and other usage information, please visit the framework's [documentation](https://minicss.org/docs). We do not provide documentation about the 'La boîte à bouillons' flavors.

## Test

We generate the mini-default flavor each time. We compare this mini-default.css with the one generated from the [mini.css](https://github.com/Chalarangelo/mini.css) (version 2.3.7) to detect any regression.
